# A Multi-modal Array of Interpretable Features

## What is it 🔎
This repository is a public open-source implementation that supports the extraction of cognitive, linguistic and acoustic features from speech recordings. This project has the aim of designing, extracting and analyzing speech and language production of subjects with different neurological disorders. 
In this repository we report the code that supports both the  **data pre-processing**, **feature extraction**, and the **statistical analysis** that we perform to evaluate the significance of the features between experimental groups. This code is associated to the paper entitled (see reference in Acknowledgements):

``` 
 A Multi-Modal Array of Interpretable Features to Evaluate Language and Speech Patterns in Different Neurological Disorders
```
## Data pre-processing 📈
Recordings from both the data sets were resmapled to 16 kHz as required by the algorithms used for the feature extraction. To resample speech recordings to 16kHz, run the script: 
  
  ```
  $ bash Data_Preprocessing/convert_to_16k.sh 
  ```
Spoken responses were automatically transcribed using a pre-trained conformer CTC  model (https://huggingface.co/csukuangfj/icefall-asr-librispeech-conformer-ctc-jit-bpe-500-2021-11-09) for the Librispeech data set built on top of icefall (https://github.com/k2-fsa/icefall). Transcriptions were manually supervised and corrected when needed. For each recording a transcription is generated in capital letters without punctuation marks. The steps followed to get speech transcripts and alignment are:

  1) Prepare your data. Please see https://lhotse.readthedocs.io/en/latest/corpus.html#adding-new-corpora for more information. You can find various recipes for different datasets in https://github.com/lhotse-speech/lhotse/tree/master/lhotse/recipes.
  2) Follow https://github.com/k2-fsa/icefall/blob/master/egs/librispeech/ASR/prepare.sh to extract features for your dataset.
  3) Adapt https://github.com/k2-fsa/icefall/blob/master/egs/librispeech/ASR/tdnn_lstm_ctc/asr_datamodule.py to your dataset.
  4) Train a model for your dataset. Please see https://github.com/k2-fsa/icefall/blob/master/egs/librispeech/ASR/conformer_ctc/train.py. With respect to this step, we did not train any model from scratch but we did use a pretrained English model.
  5) Get alignments. Please see https://github.com/k2-fsa/icefall/blob/master/egs/librispeech/ASR/conformer_ctc/ali.py

  To extract speech transcripts using your own data set, please see the notebook:

## Feature extraction 🔨
### Cognitive features 🧠

To extract the cognitive features based on speech transcripts only, the code can be found in:

  ``` 
  Feature_Extraction/Cognitive/extract_cognitive_features.py
  ```
### Linguistic Features 🔡
For the extraction of the linguistic features related to Part-of-Speech and Syntactic Complexity we use Spacy Python Library(<https://spacy.io/models>).
For the extraction of the linguistic features related to Vocabulary Richness we use <https://pypi.org/project/lexicalrichness/>. 

To extract the linguistic features reported in the paper, run:

  ``` 
  python Feature_Extraction/Linguistic/extract_linguistic_features.py
  ```
To extract the linguistic and cognitive features from the transcripts of your speech data set, you can use the notebook in:

 ``` 
  Feature_Extraction/extract_ling_cog_features.ipynb
  ```
### Acoustic features 🔊
For the extraction of the acoustic features related to pause and speech time we use DigiPsych Prosody Repository (<https://github.com/NeuroLexDiagnostics/DigiPsych_Prosody>). For the extraction of the acoustic features related F0 and energy contour we use Disvoice Repository (<https://github.com/jcvasquezc/DisVoice/tree/master/prosody>).
To install Disvoice in editable mode run:

```
$ git https://github.com/jcvasquezc/DisVoice.git
``` 
To install DigiPsych Prosody in editable mode run:

```
$ git https://github.com/NeuroLexDiagnostics/DigiPsych_Prosody.git
```
Then, to extract the acoustic features reported in the paper, run:

``` 
$ bash Feature_Extraction/Acoustic/extract_acoustic_features.sh
 ```

## Statistical analysis 📊
In order to perform pair-wise Kruskal-Wallis H-tests, apply FDR correction, compute eta-squared effect-size and AUROC for each biomarker, see the functions in the script:
``` 
  Statistical_Analysis/utils.py
 ```
## Reproducibility
Due to the licensing of the used data sets, we are not allowed to publish the recordings, the extracted features, nor the labels. However, we provided the source code to perform the feature extraction, and the statistical analysis reported in the paper.
